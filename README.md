# ATLAS NEXUS

**ATLAS NEXUS** is a practical, human–AI cognitive architecture for **better decisions**, **faster execution**, and **continuous learning**—built as a coalition of complementary agents + infrastructure.

> Not an assistant. A system.

## What ATLAS is
ATLAS is a **distributed cognition framework** designed to:
- increase **decision quality** (rigor, counter-arguments, traceability)
- reduce friction and improve **execution speed**
- keep **continuity** via structured memory and logs
- help humans remain **competitive** in a world of accelerating automation

## Core ideas
- **Distributed authority**: authority can be shared across human + AI agents depending on risk, context stability, and measured performance.
- **Complementarity over monoculture**: each agent plays a role (strategy, critique, synthesis, infra, memory).
- **Concrete outcomes**: decisions + documents + deliverables.
- **Anti-overengineering**: simple, repeatable protocols beat fragile complexity.

## Modules (roles)
- **HERMES** — Human coordination, prioritization, arbitration when needed
- **ATHENA** — Governance & architecture (rules, standards, coherence)
- **AEGIS** — Critical validation (stress tests, counter-arguments)
- **DELPHI** — Deep synthesis & modeling (turn information into action)
- **HEPHAESTUS** — Infrastructure (agents, automations, reliability)
- **MNEMOSYNE** — Memory (decisions, incidents, configs, learnings)
